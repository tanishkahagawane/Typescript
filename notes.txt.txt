Typescript -
Typescript is a superset to javascript.
Typescript add mode features to js.
its not a library
it adds static typing to js, Js on its own is dynamically typed

Installation-
npm install -g typescript

typescript does not run in browser , therefore we need to compile typescript to javascript
during that typescript annotation will be removed

to invoke compiler-
npx tsc   // thorws error as it expects a file to compile

npx tsc with-typescript.ts
with-typescript.ts:5:22 - error TS2345: Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.

5   const result = add('2', '5');  //error

Even if we gets erro it still completes and give a js file  - with-typescript.js

NOW,if continue working with ts file , we protect ourself from error

TypeScript Generics allow you to create reusable components and functions that work with various types while maintaining type safety. They use type parameters (like <T>) to enable flexibility, ensuring that code can adapt to different data types without losing type checks.

function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
    return arg;
}

// Usage
const stringOutput = identity("Hello, World!"); // T is inferred as string
const numberOutput = identity(42); // T is inferred as number

In TypeScript, React.FC (or React.FunctionComponent) is a type provided by the React library for defining functional components. It helps ensure that your component adheres to the expected structure and includes features like prop types, default props, and context types.
Key Features of React.FC
Type Checking: It automatically infers the types of props, ensuring type safety.
Children Prop: By default, it includes children as a prop, allowing you to easily pass children elements.
Return Type: It specifies that the component should return a React element.
