Typescript -
Typescript is a superset to javascript.
Typescript add mode features to js.
its not a library
it adds static typing to js, Js on its own is dynamically typed

Installation-
npm install -g typescript

typescript does not run in browser , therefore we need to compile typescript to javascript
during that typescript annotation will be removed

to invoke compiler-
npx tsc   // thorws error as it expects a file to compile

npx tsc with-typescript.ts
with-typescript.ts:5:22 - error TS2345: Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.

5   const result = add('2', '5');  //error

Even if we gets erro it still completes and give a js file  - with-typescript.js

NOW,if continue working with ts file , we protect ourself from error
